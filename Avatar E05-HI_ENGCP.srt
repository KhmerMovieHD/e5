from Gran Gran's scroll,

to get to the Northern Water Tribe.

Usually, the two remain separate,

where the barrier between them is thin.

So you think the forest

And I believe the fires
weaken the barrier even more.

00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:44,708
So you're gonna hop into the Spirit World,
grab the lost folks, and hop back.

167
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,333
Something like that. Yeah.

168
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,708
You sounded a lot more confident before.

169
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,167
Because all of this is my responsibility.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,167
Yes, I need to get to the North
so I can save the Waterbenders,

171
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,042
but I also need to help these people

172
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,667
so they don't lose their homes
and the ones they love

173
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,792
the way I lost mine.

174
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,833
It's impossible for you to do everything.

175
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,458
It's like Bumi said,
"The Avatar has to do the impossible."

176
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,583
I need to find where
the spiritual energies are strongest.

177
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,458
And where's that?

178
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,542
I'll know it when I find it.

179
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,250
You almost said something specific.

180
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,333
[grunts]

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,250
[mysterious music playing]

182
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,125
Katara?

183
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,083
Aang?

184
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,625
[screams]

185
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,958
[Aang] A shrine
to the spirit of the forest.

186
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,542
This is the place.

187
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,042
[exhales]

188
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,792
So what do we do?

189
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:16,917
We watch over Aang.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,833
Once his spirit crosses over,
his body will be vulnerable.

191
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,208
We need to protect him.

192
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,708
Oh.

193
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,167
And how will we know that this works?

194
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,208
I'm not sure.

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,750
- I'm getting hungry.
- Hey, do you mind?

196
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,167
I'm trying to concentrate here.

197
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,333
[sighs]

198
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333

00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,750
Sokka, I think it worked.

207
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,833
[Sokka] Katara?

208
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,667
Ah!

209
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,625
- What is happening?
- I don't know! Aang?

210
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:46,083
I've separated my spirit from my body,
but somehow, I brought you guys with me.

211
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,167
How is that possible?

212
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,958
Must be the energies in the place

213
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,042
and the thinness of the barrier
and my power.

214
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,042
Well, get us back! Get us back now!

215
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
I'm… I'm sorry.

[Sokka] Uh…

218
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,792
[Aang] We're in the Spirit World.

219
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,833
Don't mention the Avatar.
We can't let word get out.

220
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,792
Agreed. And we should tread lightly.

221
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,750
The Fire Nation
may control this territory,

222
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,875
but it's still Earthbender country.

223
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,208
- We don't want to cause trouble.
- When have I ever caused trouble?

224
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:30,833
[dog barking]

225
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,917
When, indeed.

226
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,750
[upbeat sitar music playing]

[man laughs]

229
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,712
[man whispers]
They're Fire Nation. Look at them.

230
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,042
Look at their garments.

231
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,875
I heard Waterbenders might've been
around these parts not long ago.

232
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,542
- Did you see them?
- No.

233
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:06,292
- But you remember hearing about them.
- Sort of.

234
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:18,042
[Zuko] Perhaps this… will help.

235
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:20,917
Now,

236
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,000
did you see the Waterbenders?

237
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,125
No.

238
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,792
[Iroh clears throat]

239
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:33,000
But I heard the Avatar might be traveling
with some Waterbenders.

240
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,917
- What did you say?
- [man] The Avatar.

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,708
He's with some Waterbenders.

242
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,250
Isn't that right, Muki?

243
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,833
What? The Avatar?
That's what those pirates said.

244
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,750
No, it wasn't the pirates.
It was that canyon guide.

245
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,375
He said the Avatar
fought off some canyon crawlers

246
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,250
with the help of a couple Waterbenders.

247
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,125
[man] Was he the one who told us about
how they stopped the volcano…

248
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,042
It seems they've heard about the Avatar.

249
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,833
[Muki] Right after they fought
the mad King of Omashu.

250
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,083
[Zuko] I'm gonna lose him.
I'm gonna lose everything!

251
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,375
If word has gotten to this backwoods hole,
that means everyone knows.

252
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,250
Everyone in the Earth Kingdom.
Everyone in the Fire Nation.

253
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,208
The hunters will be out.
There's blood in the water now.

[man grunts]

Don't die, you idiot.

00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,167
I only get half if you die.

262
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,667
What are you looking at?

263
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,583
A low-life bounty hunter.

264
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,625
Low-life? Big talk for a little boy.

265
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,083
I'll let it pass
'cause your dad's kinda cute.

266
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,958
Should've known they would've let
mercenaries run wild here.

267
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,768
[Aang] Gyatso used to tell me that
the Spirit World and the physical world

268
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:25,792
are tied together.

269
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,167
What happens to one affects the other.
It's kinda like your soul and your body.

270
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,208
Separate but connected.

271
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,333
[Katara] That makes sense.

272
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,250
Gyatso had a way
of making things easy to understand.

273
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,542
He made everything easy.

274
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,375
He sounds amazing.

275
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,083
He was.

276
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,250
You know, I've always felt
I was a spiritually-attuned person.

277
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,625
- Might be why I crossed over with you.
- Is that a frog or a froggy thing?

278
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,917
[croaking]

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I have no idea how he got in here.

280
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,458
The villagers are probably trying
to find a way out.

281
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,958
They're probably looking
for something familiar.

282
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,672
Assuming they realize
they don't belong in here.

283
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,208
[deep voice] None of you belong in here.

284
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,958
Uh, who said that?

285
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,542
Who said what?

286
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,958
[voice] No human belongs in this realm.

287
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,250
That is one big birdie.

288
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,500
"Birdie"?

289
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,375
I am no birdie.

290
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:25,083
I am the spirit of knowledge itself.

291
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:28,208
Please excuse Sokka.
He didn't mean anything.

292
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,958
- Aang, who are you talking to?
- What do you mean?

293
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,500
They do not hear what you hear.

294
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:37,542
[hooting]

295
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:43,333
[owl] Their small minds are incapable
of comprehending my speech.

296
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,792
But I hear you.

297
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,500
[owl] You are the Avatar.

298
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,250
You were meant
to have one foot in this world.

299
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,083
They, however, are interlopers.

300
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,583
And the longer they stay,

301
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,833
the more dangerous
it will become for them.

302
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:58,917
Dangerous?

303
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,333
Dangerous?

304
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,333
The birdie's not gonna eat us, is it?

305
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:05,000
That should be the least of his worries.

306
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,792
There are creatures in here
that will do far more

307
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,792
than devour your body.

308
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,167
They'll eat your soul.

309
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
Aang? What's he saying?

310
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,625
He says he's not gonna hurt us.

311
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,208
All we want is
to find our missing friends,

312
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,542
and we'll get out of here.

313
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:27,125
There is one who lives in a stone hut
not far beyond the woods.

314
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,583
He may know what's become of your friends.

315
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,000
Follow the path, and you will find him.

316
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,500
Wait. Wait.
What did you mean about danger?

317
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,125
What could happen to them?

318
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:43,750
There are things in here
that will reveal truths to humans.

319
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,917
Truths they're never prepared to face.

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,917
It will show them who they really are,

321
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,417
and that can cause a great deal of pain.

322
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,125
Farewell, Avatar,

323
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,333
and remember, stay on the path.

324
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,208
[caws]

325
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,333
Bye-bye, Birdie.

326
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,708
- [man] That's enough.
- [grunting]

327
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,292
- The lesson is over, Your Highness.
- [grunting]

328
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,375
[Mai] Azula!

329
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,458
[grunting]

330
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:15,667
[Mai] Azula!

331
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,917
Azula!

332
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
[panting]

333
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,750
[man 2] Are you okay?
Here, let me help you.

334
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,417
Um,

335
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
that was intense.

336
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,833
Yeah.

337
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,833
- You could've hurt him.
- That's his fault.

338
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,458
He should've been better.

339
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:41,417
Except this wasn't about the trainer…
was it?

340
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
[foreboding music playing]

341
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,208
Azula, you're the best.

342
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,292
Everybody knows that.

343
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,500
You're perfect.

344
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,750
That's not good enough.

345
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,513
[Zuko] There you are. Where have you been?

346
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:06,125
Apologies. I got distracted
watching a game of Pai Sho.

347
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,333
The street players in these parts
are quite good.

348
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,917
I'm sure they are. Now let's go.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,250
They didn't follow the expected tactics,
but that was their strength.

350
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,250
Uncle, is there any chance
you could finish this story on the boat?

351
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,083
Prince Zuko, there is much you can learn
from these Pai Sho players.

352
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:28,500
They are untrained, but that only means
their minds are open to new ideas.

353
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,208
And so they are ready
when a solution reveals itself.

354
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,417
No!

355
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,417
June is the best at what she does,
and that's finding people.

356
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,250
She's a mercenary.
Her loyalty is bought and sold.

357
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,000
How can you trust someone like that?

358
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,917
[Iroh] June is a professional.

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,917
If she fails, she doesn't get paid,
and she doesn't eat.

360
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,292
[exhales]

361
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,708
Prince Zuko,
I know you have always believed

362
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,958
there is a right and a wrong way
of doing things.

363
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,917
It is a mark of a great leader,

364
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,333
but the rules are different out here.

365
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,000
Commander Zhao knows this,

366
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:19,292
and he's already making moves
while we have yet to draw our tiles.

367
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,375
[suspenseful music playing]

[sighs]

369
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,625
So… tell me about this Avatar.

370
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,167
Um…

371
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,542
[mysterious music playing]

372
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,792
[Sokka hyperventilating]

373
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,250
- Oh, did you see that?
- See what?

374
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,667
Did you see… that?

375
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,333
[Katara] Sokka, relax.

376
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,208
The owl said we'd be fine
as long as we stuck to the path.

377
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,292
Right, Aang?

378
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,125
Right.

379
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,750
Aang? What did the owl really say?

380
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,000
He said it could be dangerous
for you guys in here.

381
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,500
That you might have to face the truth.

382
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,208
But how bad could the truth be, right?

383
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,500
Right.

384
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,083
Right?

385
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,167
The truth.

386
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,208
Yeah.

387
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,583
Yeah, I can deal with the truth.

388
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,917
What I can't deal with is getting eaten
by some giant spirit monster.

[suspenseful music playing]

392
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,542
Aang, please tell me that's some
spirit language only you can understand,

393
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,667
and it's saying, "Welcome, friends,
would you like some cake?"

394
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,417
That's not what it's saying.

395

[growling]

396
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:58,167
[Aang] Just stay on the path.

397
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,417
The owl said it'd be okay
as long as we stay on the path.

398

- We're on the path. We're on the path.

It's the spirit of the forest.

It's wounded.

I can't bend. I can't bend!

I can't either.

Pain.

421
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,000
So much pain.

422
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,458
Actually, they're just scratches.

423
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,833
[fox] Not you. Hei Bai.

424
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:31,167
Hey, what?

425
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,417
Hei Bai. That spirit.

426
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,333
It's in a lot of pain.

427
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,458
I must've landed harder than I thought.

428
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,875
I'm a little discombobulated.

[distant growl]

434

I need to get to my friends
before they get eaten by that monster.

435
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,708
It's not a monster. It's hurt.

436
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,750
That's what pain does to you.

437
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,000
It changes you
into something that you're not.

438
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,375
Don't you know what it's like to be hurt?

439
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,833
Well, these scratches
are making me pretty irritable, so…

440
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:13,375
Do you always make jokes
when you don't wanna talk about something?

441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,417
What? That's not what I do.

442
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:20,333
You should go.
I hope you can "recombobulate."

- [soldier 2] Go!

490
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,292
Katara, we have to get inside now!

491
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,667
No, I'm not going in there!

492
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,292
[explosion]

493
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,375
[indistinct yelling]

494
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,083
[Katara's mom] Hide.

495
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,542
And whatever you do, don't come out.

496
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,458
[gasps]

497
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:35,250
Where's the Waterbender?
We know you have one in the village.

498
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,833
All the Waterbenders are gone or dead
because of you.

499
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,333
You're lying.

500
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,958
Turn the bender over.

501
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,375
[Katara's mom gasps]

502
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,667
Or die.

503
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,375
[breathing shakily]

504
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,458
[explosion]

505
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:15,542
[villagers scream]

506
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:21,875
[gasps]

507
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,000
Wait!

508
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:33,875
It's me.

509
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,083
I'm the Waterbender.

510
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,542
[somber music playing]

511
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,917
[screams]

512
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,417
[deep voice] So much fear.

513
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:08,208
So much despair.

514
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,458
[Katara gasps]

515
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,333
[Sokka] Ooh.

516
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,083
Spirit World. More like mud world.

517
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,708
[sniffs]

518
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,625
It smells like Appa after a rainstorm.

519
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,250
[crunching]

520
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,042
Well, that doesn't seem right.

521
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,875
[mysterious whir]

522
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
[panting]

523
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,417
Dad?

524
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,708
[chuckles]

525
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,417
[Sokka's dad] The spirits of water
bear witness to this mark.

526
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:11,375
For the strength and leadership
displayed during his ice-dodging trials,

527
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,042
I grant this Mark of the Wise…

528
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,708
to Sokka.

529
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,250
To my son.

530
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,333
[men] Huh!

531
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,417
This is the day of my ice-dodging trials.

532
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,167
This is the day
you passed your ice-dodging trials.

533
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,625
Just as the warriors in our family
always have.

534
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,250
- [door opens]
- [man] You did make it exciting though.

535
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,417
Bato!

536
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,083
You were cutting it a little close
around those icebergs, weren't ya?

537
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,583
Yeah, that's right. I lost control.

538
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:47,792
I…

539
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,375
I didn't know what to do.

540
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,875
If you hadn't have been on the boat
and stepped in…

541
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,333
[Bato] We all came through in one piece.

542
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,375
That's all that matters. Right, Hakoda?

543
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:03,583
Yes, that's right,
and selecting the right crew

544
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,583
is part of being a wise leader.

545
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,208
It's why we do the trials
with help from our friends.

546
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,583
[Bato] You see?

547
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,125
Why don't you go find your sister?
And we can all celebrate.

548
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,792
[door opens]

549
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,458
[indistinct chatter]

550
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,750
Hey, Sokka.

551
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,833
We just saw your ice-dodging cutter
or what remains of it.

552
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,042
If this is how you pass a test,

553
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,500
I'd hate to see
what you do to a boat when you fail.

554
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,792
[kids laughing]

555
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,958
[boy] What a joke.

556
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,125
[Bato] I didn't think
he'd get in trouble that quickly.

557
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:41,083
If it weren't for you,
Sokka would have wrecked us.

558
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,208
We're lucky to be alive.

559
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:46,208
[Bato] It was tricky. Even I only saw
the breakers at the last second.

560
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,750
You don't have to make excuses for him.

561
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,542
I'd hoped,

562
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,250
when he really had to prove himself,
that he'd do…

563
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,292
better.

564
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:07,042
The truth is, not everyone is meant
to have people's lives in their hands.

565
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,708
[weeping]

566
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:19,042
[somber music playing]

567
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,125
[footsteps approaching]

568
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,292
[deep voice] Give in to your despair.

569
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,417
[gasps]

570
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,042
[wind blowing]

571
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,292
[Aang] Katara!

572
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Sokka!

573
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:56,167
[indistinct chatter]

574
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,542
[emotional music playing]

575
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,375
Home.

576
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:14,792
It isn't real.

577
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,375
It isn't real.

578
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,958
[sighs]

579
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,208
[sighs]

580
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,000
[rustling]

581
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,625
- [mysterious whirring]
- [distant laughing]

582
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,875
What have we here?

583
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,125
Someone who can resist?

584
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,333
That can't be possible.

585
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:36,917
Unless…

586
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,958
Ah, of course.

587
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,083
It's my old friend, the Avatar.

588
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,500
Do I know you?

589
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,250
[creature] I should say so.

590
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:53,542
One of your previous incarnations
tried to slay me.

591
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,958
Why would I try to kill you?

592
00:36:56,042 --> 00:37:01,542
Oh, it was something about
stealing the face of someone you loved.

593
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,250
But you know all about stealing,
don't you?

594
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:09,875
Perhaps you've come
to return what you stole from me.

595
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:14,125
I don't know what you're talking about.
All I want is to find my friends.

596
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,208
[laughs]

597
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,875
Your friends?

598
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:26,375
Now, why would I let you
play with my food?

599
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,292
[suspenseful music swells]

600
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,667
[creature's footsteps approaching]

601
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,625
[creature laughing]

602
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,542
[suspenseful music continues]

603
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,042
[grunts]

604
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:52,292
[heartfelt music playing]

605
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
[tapping]

606
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,250
Hello?

607
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:09,917
Aang?

608
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,542
Gyatso?

609
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,542
[chuckles] Aang!

610
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,375
You finally made it!

611
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,333
This isn't… this isn't real.
It can't be. It's another trick.

612
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,042
It's another illusion.

613
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:31,000
I know it's hard to believe,
but… it's really me.

614
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:36,125
There are lots of Illusions here,
but you've emerged from the fog.

615
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,833
This is real.

616
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,167
Recognize this?

617
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,000
One of the last games we played.

618
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,250
Hey!

619
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,333
[Aang grunts]

620
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Ah.

621
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,375
Your turn.

622
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:01,458
Cheater.

623
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,333
[laughs]

624
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:06,417
[sentimental music swells]

625
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:19,333
I can't believe it's really you.

626
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,167
How is this possible?

627
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,000
How are you… here?

628
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,708
Ah. Well…

629
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,542
after you left the Southern Air Temple,
the Firebenders attacked.

630
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:36,542
It was sudden and swift.

631
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,500
Most who perished
moved on in the Great Cycle.

632
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,083
I chose a different path.

633
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,542
You chose not to move on
to the next stage of enlightenment?

634
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,833
Why?

635
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:50,958
Because

636
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,250
I knew you would need me.

637
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,708
I do need you.

638
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,542
I'm supposed to be the Avatar,
and everyone is counting on me,

639
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,750
except I don't know what I'm doing.

640
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,833
But now you're here.

641
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,292
Aang, I can't tell you
how to be the Avatar.

642
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,000
Of course you can.

643
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:16,167
Avatar Kyoshi told me
that I need to get to the North

644
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,458
to prevent a great tragedy from happening.

645
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,000
Except… I don't know how.

646
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,667
I don't know anything.

647
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,333
- You know a lot more than you think.
- [Aang] I doubt that.

648
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:30,167
I mean, how am I supposed
to save the world

649
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,542
if I can't even save…

650
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,625
my friends?

651
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,083
They're somewhere in the fog.

652
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,167
Ah.

653
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:39,917
[grunts]

654
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,750
That is the Fog of Lost Souls.

655
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,292
A place that imprisons people
in their darkest memories,

656
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:52,500
and it is the hunting ground for Koh,
the face stealer.

657
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:56,417
He preys on those
paralyzed by despair and doubt.

658
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:01,042
He must have the villagers too.
The ones we came to rescue.

659
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,875
[Gyatso] <i>Koh</i>
<i>will have taken them to his lair.</i>

660
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>Koh will hold them there
until he's ready to feed.</i>

661
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:11,083
[squelching]

662
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,250
[Gyatso] <i>When that happens,</i>

663
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,208
<i>their souls will be lost forever.</i>

664
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:16,750
[Koh chitters]

665
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,750
I have to save them!

666
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,750
Koh is a primal spirit,

667
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,583
a dangerous and ruthless predator.

668
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,292
There is no way to defeat him.

669
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,542
I have to try.

670
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,708
I have to do something.

671
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Koh.

672
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,500
He said that he knew me.

673
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,750
That I've taken something from him.

674
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,750
It's true. Previous Avatars
have tangled with Koh.

675
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:48,542
It's said Roku once
even got the best of the spirit,

676
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,917
but nobody knows exactly what happened.

677
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Okay.

678
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,250
Then… I need to talk to Roku.

679
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,458
I've contacted Avatar Kyoshi
at her shrine.

680
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,875
I can do the same with Roku.

681
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,917
Except Roku's temple
is in the Fire Nation.

682
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,833
- It'll be a dangerous journey.
- I don't have a choice.

683
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'll be back.

684
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,042
[Gyatso] Aang!

685
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:14,250
There's something I need to tell you.

686
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:21,458
You… couldn't have done anything…
if you'd stayed with us.

687
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,708
You couldn't have stopped the Fire Nation.

688
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,292
You couldn't have prevented the war.

689
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,583
You would have just died
along with everyone else.

690
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,417
It's not your fault.

691
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,292
So… let go.

692
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:46,958
[sighs]

693
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,542
Can we talk about it when I get back?

694
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:55,958
Of course.

695
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,333
You should hurry.
Koh will feed again before too long.

696
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:04,542
Right. Once I save my friends,
we'll have more time.

697
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,792
[sentimental music playing]

698
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:20,792
Time.

699
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,625
Time is a funny thing.

700
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:26,208
The past, the future,

701
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,667
it all gets mixed up.

702

[mystical whirring]

703

704
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,625
<i>It's by remembering what really matters.</i>

705
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,292
[Aang] I hope
you can help me, Avatar Roku.

706
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,833
I know you're in pain. I saw your spirit.

707
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:18,750
I'm gonna make this right,
and I'm gonna save my friends.

708
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:20,417
I promise.

709
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,292
[Appa grunts]

710
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,708
- Sorry, buddy. You can't come this time.
- [Momo squeaks]

711
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,458
- [Appa grunts]
- You too, Momo.

[Appa groans]

713
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,250
It's too dangerous.

714
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,458
Keep them safe for me, okay?
